## Hidden gems worth the journey

The most rewarding beaches require effort to reach—and that's precisely why they remain uncrowded. These **12 hidden gems** range from 30-minute trails to full-day adventures.

### Lagoinha do Leste — The island's crown jewel

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Region** | South |
| **Access** | 1-3 hour hike only (or boat ~R$50-80) |
| **Waves** | 5/5 — Powerful open-ocean surf |
| **Crowds** | 1/5 — Empty most days |
| **Infrastructure** | 0/5 — Absolutely nothing |
| **Water** | Crystal clear, cold Atlantic |

Two trail options exist: from **Pântano do Sul** (2.4km, ~1 hour, steep with stairs) or from **Matadeiro Beach** (3.6km, ~3 hours, more scenic with cliff views). The beach features a stunning freshwater lagoon meeting the sea—a geological phenomenon that creates the name. The iconic **Morro da Coroa** rock formation offers spectacular views but demands careful climbing (very slippery). Wild camping is permitted, with fresh water available from a stream on the left side of the beach. **Pro tip**: Hike in from Matadeiro when fresh, return via Pântano do Sul, then reward yourself at Bar do Arante restaurant.

### Praia do Saquinho — Off-grid paradise

The **cement trail** (built to help residents transport goods) can be extremely slippery when wet due to moss—proper footwear essential. At the trail's peak, the **"Pedra da Vigia"** lookout offers panoramic views of Solidão, Açores, Pântano do Sul, and the Moleques do Sul islands—excellent for whale and dolphin watching. The community of approximately six permanent residents maintains native Azorean customs. **No cell signal** in most areas. Bring all trash back—no garbage collection exists.

### Praia dos Naufragados — Shipwreck Beach

The **Forte Marechal Moura** (early 1900s) contains WWII-era cannons. A freshwater river crosses the beach—perfect for warmer bathing than the cold ocean. Return options include asking fishermen for boat rides (~R$20-30).

## Essential tips for hidden beach exploration

**Always bring**: Minimum 2L water per person, sunscreen, proper hiking shoes with grip, snacks/lunch (most have NO food), garbage bag (leave no trace), first aid kit, fully charged phone with offline maps downloaded.

**Safety warnings**: Many beaches have NO lifeguards. Cell signal often unavailable. Trail conditions change dramatically with rain. Watch for venomous snakes and spiders in warmer months. Strong currents at open-sea beaches. Always tell someone your plans.

**Water temperature**: North beaches warmest (23-26°C summer). East and south significantly colder—wetsuit recommended for extended surf sessions. Lagoa do Peri (freshwater) warmest swimming.

**Traffic warning**: SC-401 to North beaches becomes extremely congested during summer—arrive early or expect delays. South beaches via SC-405 less problematic but still busy on peak weekends.

The magic of Florianópolis lies in the variety—from Instagram-famous beach clubs to nameless coves that don't appear on any map. The hidden gems reward those willing to walk a little further, start a little earlier, and venture beyond the obvious. Praia do Novo Campeche represents exactly this spirit: not difficult to reach, but overlooked by tourists chasing the famous names, and all the more special for it.
